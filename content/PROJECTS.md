## ðŸ§  CognetMD â€“ Cognitive Network Evaluation Toolkit for Medical Domains

**Dataset:** [COGNET-MD on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DimitriosPanagoulias/COGNET-MD)  
**Published Chapter:** [Springer LNNS 2024, Chapter 38](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-9559-8_38)

**Summary:**  
**COGNET-MD** is a benchmark dataset and evaluation framework developed for assessing the **correctness of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs)** in medical settings. It provides a curated collection of **Multiple Choice Quizzes (MCQs)** authored and reviewed by medical professionals, specifically targeting LLMs' reasoning accuracy in specialized domains.

**Key Features:**
- Covers five key medical fields: **Psychiatry, Dentistry, Pulmonology, Dermatology**, and **Endocrinology**
- Includes MCQs with **varying difficulty levels** and **multiple correct answers**
- Proposes a **custom scoring scheme** that:
  - Awards **partial credit** for partially correct responses
  - Assigns **full credit** for entirely correct answers
  - **Penalizes** overconfidence by subtracting 0.5 points for each incorrect selection

**Intended Use Cases:**
- Fine-tuning and evaluation of domain-specific LLMs
- Comparative benchmarking across general-purpose and medical-tuned models
- Developing trustworthy, explainable AI systems for medical education and decision support

**Relevance:**  
CognetMD plays a foundational role in the evaluation loop of **Dermacen Analytica** and supports broader research efforts in **explainable medical AI and model validation**. It serves as a gold-standard dataset for future publications and applications involving LLM correctness in critical domains.
